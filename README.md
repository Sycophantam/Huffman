# Huffman
Simple implementation of a Huffman encoder/decoder

To compile and run the program, use the makefile by typing "make" in your terminal to generate the executable. 
Then run the executable file, passing in your text files you want to encode on the command line. (huffman.exe file.txt) The program will compress the file, storing it as {file}_encoded.bin, and decompress the file, storing it as {file}_recreated.txt.
